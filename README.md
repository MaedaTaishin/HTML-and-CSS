I was in University's Computer Website club called "WINC" for a bit. 
During the time in the circle, I have studied HTML and CSS through online websites with my friends.
We had opportunities to have a look, edit, and modify the club's frontend websites.
My HTML and CSS pratices are included as well as the demo of the club's website that I had modified and translated some parts into English.
